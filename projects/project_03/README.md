# Project 03: Memory

Task: Use HDL (hardware description language) to build fundamental memory chips starting from provided data flip-flops (DFFs) to building n-bit registers and m-register RAM devices.

Important takeaway: Reading and writing to memory is quick as combinational logic (time-independent operations) are used to do these operations whereas storage uses DFFs which is a time-dependent operation)

Goal: Understand how memory devices in computers work and their building blocks

Deliverables:
* DFF (memory primitive given out value equal to in)
* Bit (use DFF to set out to previous out or new in value)
* Register (build on DFFs)
* Program Counter (aka PC - uses both DFFs and Incrementor chip) 
* RAM8 (builds on registers)
* RAM64 (builds on RAM8)
* RAM512 (builds on RAM64)
* RAM4K (builds on RAM512)
* RAM16K (builds on RAM4K)
