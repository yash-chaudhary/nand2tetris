Task: Build a computer using the von-Neumann architecture which includes ROM for instruction memory, RAM for data memory and a CPU for computation.

Goal: To build a computer using HDL.

Deliverables:

Memory.hdl (HDL that specifies 16K memory to hold program data, 8K memory map to hold screen data and 1 16-bit word to hold keyboard value)
CPU.hdl (HDL that specifies how a given instruction is decoded and computed using the ALU)
Computer.hdl (HDL that specifies the computer abstraction and includes the ROM, RAM and CPU modules)
