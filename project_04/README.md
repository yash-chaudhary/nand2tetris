Task: Use assembly language to write simple instructions for a CPU emulator to carry out.

Important takeaway: Assembly language is versatile only because assembler agents convert such code into binary machine that the computer can understand. ROM - read only memory contains instructions that the computer will execute while RAM contains program data.

Goal: To get an idea of how assembly languages work and how assemblers interpret these programs and convert them to binary files

Deliverables:
* Mult.asm (Hack assembly code to multiply two numbers)
* Fill.asm (Hack assembly code to fill screen based on keyboard key press)
