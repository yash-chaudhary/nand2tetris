# Project 01: Boolean Logic

Task: Use HDL (hardware description language) to build primitive logic gates that form the basis of computing.

Goal: Understand that primtive gates like AND, OR, NOT can all be built with NAND or NOR gates. Furthermore XOR, Multiplexers, Demultiplexers, m-way Mux and DMux are built with primitive gates that under the hood are implemented with NAND gates.

Deliverables:
* Nand (provided)
* Not
* And
* Or
* Xor (exclusive OR)
* Mux (2 input multiplexer)
* DMux (1 input 2 output demultiplexer)
* Not16 (16-bit Not gate)
* And16 (16-bit And gate
* Or16 (16-bit Or gate)
* Mux16 (16 bit multiplexer)
* Or8Way (8 input Or gate)
* Mux4Way16 (16-bit 4 input multiplexer)
* Mux8Way16 (16-bit 9 input multiplexer)
* DMux4Way (4 input demultiplexer)
* DMux8Way (8 input demultiplexer)
