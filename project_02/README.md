# Project 02: Boolean Arithmetic

Task: Use HDL (hardware description language) to build fundamental arithmetic gates from primitive gates and chips.

Goal: Understand that addition arithmetic is runs all computers and implement adders and arithmetic logic unit (ALU). 

Deliverables:
* HalfAdder (adds two bits together, producing a carry and sum)
* FullAdder (adds three bits together, producing a carry and sum)
* Add16 (adds two 16-bit numbers together using halfadder and fulladder)
* Inc16 (increments 16-bit number by 1)
* ALU (allows 18 different arithmetic operations to take place depending on value of control inputs)
